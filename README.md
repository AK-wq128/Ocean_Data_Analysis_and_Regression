# Ocean Data Analysis and Regression
This project explores ocean water sample data and presents a Ridge Regression model for use in estimating the salinity of a sample based on the temperature of that sample.

The dataset used can be viewed on Kaggle following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi. There are two datasets posted, but only the dataset titled "bottle" was used for this project.
